Easy Chef Shopping revamped 
===========================

## What is in here? ##

The purpose of this project is to make an improvement to the look and feel of the Android App *Easy Chef Shopping*. To accomplish this, and in order to learn a new methodology, we will use [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com), the Advanced HTML5 Hybrid Mobile App Framework, a front-end SDK for developing hybrid mobile apps with HTML5. Also we will follow the guidelines on [AngularJS Modular structure Demo](https://github.com/johnpapa/ng-demos/tree/master/modular) and [AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) by [John Papa](http://www.johnpapa.net)

## Main libraries

The following libraries are used in this project:

*   [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
*   [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com)
*   [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
*   [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
*   [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io)


## Prerequisites

To start the project, firstly they are needed the following requirements:

*   [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and its package manager (npm)
*   [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
*   [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) ( ruby gem )


## Install

1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
2. `cd <project>`
3. `npm -g install bower gulp`
4. `ionic setup sass`


## Run dev server

To start a developer server, you should use [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/)

    cd <project>
    ionic serve

It will be opened a browser with the address `http://localhost:8000`. Ionic will start the server with live reload and the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) tasks for watch changes and compile Sass files if needed.
